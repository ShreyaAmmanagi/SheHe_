<div class="div09">
<p>So as we can see, the percentage of people who did not face inequality regarding their gender is 64.3%. And the percentage</p>
<p>of people who faced is 35.7%. It was kinda good result as comparitively there are less number of people who faced inequality</p>
<p>regarding their gender. But still, we have to try our best to bring that 35.7% to 0%</p>
