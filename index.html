  <p>Hi there! How are you? And moreover, who are you?! Surely, your answer would be your name...</p>
  <p>But don't you feel you are more than just a name given to you? Ok for now, you are still a human being...</p>
  <p>Let's keep it till here as the article 'Who are we?' in the top has got a job ;). </p>
  <p>Okay, now let's go back to where we were. Human being, right? So first imagine this-</p>
  <p>A human has made its debut. What do you think is the first thing the parents would do as humans?</p>
  <p>Get to know the GENDER of the human born?</p>
  <p>Based on this GENDER they name the human, get him/her some toys and clothes, etc.</p>
  <p>But is it really that important to get these things based on their gender?(think about it)</p>
  <p>It's mostly the female humans who get clothes in pink color whilst the male ones get blue in color</p>
  <img src="baby (1).png" width="100" height="120">  <img src="baby (2).png"width ="100" height="120">
  <p>Even in the toys they get, it's mostly the girls who get Barbie dolls while the boys get toys like cars...</p>
  <img src="doll.png"width = "120" height="150"> <img src="car.png" width="150" height="100">
  <p>Do you think these differences should be there when we all belong to the same race? </p>
  <p>Do you think this she or he that important?</p>
  <p>hmmmmm... think about it yourself!</p>
  <p>Well, according to our observations, they are unnecessary.</p>
  <p>So instead of differentiating it as pink and blue let's bring them together to make it purple</p>
